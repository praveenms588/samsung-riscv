<summary> <b>Task 1:</b></summary>
<br>
Task is to refer to C based and RISCV based lab videos and execute the task of compiling the C code using gcc and riscv compiler	
**C and RISC-V Based Labs**

This repository demonstrates the processes involved in compiling C programs and generating assembly code using both a standard GCC compiler and a RISC-V GCC compiler. It includes comprehensive steps and explanations to guide users through each stage of the compilation and debugging workflow.

**C Language-Based Lab**

*Steps to Compile a .c File on Your Machine:*

1. Open the bash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your file.
2. Use the following command to create and edit a new .c file:
   ```sh
   gedit sum_1ton.c
![sum1ton_code_snippet](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04232a53-ca09-4015-85fb-3a441fc0b7dd)
**Steps to Compile a .c File :**
 ```sh
 gcc sum_1ton.c
 ./a.out
```
**Compilation and execution complete.**

**RISC-V Based Lab**

### Steps to Compile Using RISC-V GCC Compiler:
1. Ensure the RISC-V GCC compiler is installed and accessible on your system.
2. Verify the .c file contents using the cat command:
```sh
cat sum_1ton.c
```

4. Compile the C program for RISC-V architecture using:
 ```sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_1ton.o sum_1ton.c
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
```
![O1 and Ofast](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/463e27c5-465e-4dd3-ae1c-899aae08c371)


5. Disassemble the object file to view its assembly code using:
 ```sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum_1ton.o
```
6. Use /main in the terminal to locate the main function in the assembly output.

**Explanation of Commands and Options:**
1. -mabi=lp64: Specifies the Application Binary Interface (ABI) for 64-bit integers, pointers, and long data types, suitable for 64-bit RISC-V architecture.

2. -march=rv64i: Indicates the 64-bit RISC-V base integer instruction set architecture.

3. -O1: Enables basic optimization for better performance without significantly increasing compilation time.
  
4. -Ofast: Focuses on maximizing performance by enabling aggressive optimizations, potentially at the cost of standard compliance.

5. riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump: A tool for disassembling RISC-V binaries to examine the code structure and debug it effectively.

**Debugging with SPIKE: Comparing -O1 and -Ofast Optimizations**

**-O1:** A moderate optimization for balanced performance.

**-Ofast:** A high-speed optimization that prioritizes performance over strict standards
